    "## About this Part\n\nCongrats!\nYou have reached the last Part of this Sprint.\nIn this Part, you will put what you learned during this and the previous Sprints into practice.\nAs the final assignment of this Sprint, you will train and deploy a machine learning model on the Stroke Prediction Dataset.\nYou will have to apply all that you have learned about training and deploying machine learning models to complete this task.\nOur expectation is that you'll use your own judgment on how to perform the analysis and how to select the most important avenues of modeling, statistical testing, and exploration.\nYou'll have to iteratively try to find patterns in the data, raise hypotheses and use your data analysis skills to get answers.\n\nP.S. we don't expect this project to be perfect - you will continue to improve your skills, and there will be many projects for you to apply your newly gained skills in the future.\nFor now, just use what you have learned and try your best!\n\n*Note:* [advice on building your portfolio](https://turingcollege.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DLG/pages/1002307695/Portfolio+Items)\n\n## Context\n\nImagine that you are a data analyst working for The Johns Hopkins Hospital.\nYour team is asked to create a machine learning model, which could predict if the patient is likely to get a stroke - being able to determine which patients have high stroke risk will allow your doctors to advise them and their families on how to act in case of an emergency.\n\n## Objectives for this Part\n\n- Practice working with CSV files.\n- Practice performing EDA.\n- Practice applying statistical inference procedures.\n- Practice using various types of machine learning models.\n- Practice building ensembles of machine learning models.\n- Practice deploying machine learning models.\n- Practice visualizing data with Matplotlib & Seaborn.\n- Practice reading data, performing queries, and filtering data.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Download the data from [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset).\n- Perform exploratory data analysis. This should include creating statistical summaries and charts, testing for anomalies, and checking for correlations and other relations between variables and other EDA elements.\n- Perform statistical inference. This should include defining the target population, forming multiple statistical hypotheses and constructing confidence intervals, setting the significance levels, and conducting z or t-tests for these hypotheses.\n- Apply various machine learning models to predict the \"stroke\" column using all other features. This should include hyperparameter tuning, model ensembling, the analysis of model selection, and other methods. Suggestion: you might want to investigate how to use (scikit-learn pipelines)[https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html] to make your training pipelines more robust.\n- Deploy the machine learning model. Choose the best performing model and deploy it. You are free to choose any deployment option that you like - you can deploy your model in a container (on your computer or on a server), do a serverless deployment on the cloud, or even deploy and serve it on the browser as a web app.\n- Provide clear explanations in your notebook. Your explanations should inform the reader what you are trying to achieve, what results did you get, and what these results mean.\n- Provide suggestions about how your analysis can be improved.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\n\n- Adherence to the requirements. How well did you meet the requirements?\n- Depth of your analysis. Did you just skim the surface, or did you explore the dataset in-depth?\n- Model's performance. How well did your model perform the predictions?\n- Visualization quality. Did you use charts effectively to visualize patterns in the data? Are your visualizations properly labeled? Did you use colors effectively? Did you adhere to the principle of proportional ink?\n- Code quality. Was your code well-structured? Did you use the appropriate levels of abstraction? Did you remove commented-out and unused code? Did you adhere to the PEP8?\n- Code performance. Did you use suitable algorithms and data structures to solve the problems?\n\n## Project Review\n\nDuring your project review, you should present your project as if talking to a product manager and senior data analyst working in your team.\nYou will have to find the right balance between explaining the business side and the technical aspects of your work.\nYou can assume that both of your colleagues have a strong understanding of and are very interested in the business aspect of your project, so be sure to clearly explain what new insights you've found while analyzing the dataset and which directions look the most promising for further research. \nHowever, you should also spend time explaining the technical aspects of your work, especially the more complex or unconventional choices.\n\nDuring a project review, you may get asked questions that test your understanding of covered topics.\n\n- What is wrong with preprocessing data before we run a hyperparameter search algorithm (e.g., randomized search) with cross-validation?\n- What are the typical model deployment patterns? What are their advantages and disadvantages?\n- How do hidden feedback loops affect machine learning models? Can you give an example of a hidden feedback loop?\n"
