# <p style="font-family: 'Brush Script MT', cursive;">Hello!</p>

Hi! Thank you for reviewing my project!

My name is Tauras Aleksandravicius and this is my Data Science Module 3 Sprint 3 project.
In this project I focused on  **supervised Machine learning fundamentals**.
For this purpose I worked with a small dataset with a Spaceship Titanic data. [Link to the Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic)

**Requirements:**
Please run first:

```Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

My repository contains the following files:
- **M3S3-TA-project.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook file with my project.
- **tools.py**: My functions 
- **train.csv**: Used dataset for analysis.
- **test.csv**: Testing file to test model's performance.
- **submission.csv**: Submitted predictions to Kaggle. Accuracy - 80%.
- This readme file.


Thank you for your attention!

Have a good day!

# <p style="font-family: 'Brush Script MT', cursive;">Conclusions:</p>
* Model achieved 80% f1 score - 4/5 people were correctly classificed as Transported.
* CryoSleep, Spend features were the most important predictors.
* Feature Engineering techniques tried and used in modelling. It improved model performance.
* The ones who did not travel alone were more likely to be transported.
* Ones who were on deck B, C and S side were more likely to be transported.
* Cross-Validation showed that model is not likely over/under fitting;
