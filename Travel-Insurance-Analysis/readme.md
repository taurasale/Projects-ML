Hi! Thank you for reviewing my project!

My name is Tauras Aleksandravicius and this is my Data Science Module 3 Sprint 1 project.
In this project I focused on conducting **Machine Learning tasks**.

For this purpose I worked with a small dataset with a Travel Insurance Data. [Link to the Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tejashvi14/travel-insurance-prediction-data/data)

My repository contains the following files:
- **M3S1.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook file with my project.
- **Tools/init.py**: My created class with methods for Data Analysis.
- This readme file.

**Requirements:**
Please be sure to have these packages on your virtual environment:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- dtale (Notice: Please run the Notebook locally to see UI)
- scikit-learn
- phik

Thank you for your attention!

Have a good day!
