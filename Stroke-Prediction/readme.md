Hi! Thank you for reviewing my project!

My name is Tauras Aleksandravicius and this is my Data Science Module 3 Sprint 2 project.
In this project I focused on  **supervised Machine learning fundamentals**.

For this purpose I worked with a small dataset with a Stroke prediction data. [Link to the Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)

My repository contains the following files:
- **M3S2 project.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook file with my project.
- **Tools/init.py**: My created class with methods for Data Analysis.
- **healthcare-dataset-storke-data.csv**: Used dataset for analysis.
- **model.joblib**: Final ML model.
- **app.py**: Flask App.
- **test.py**: Testing file to test model's performance.
- This readme file.

**Requirements:**
Please be sure to have these packages on your environment:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- ydata_profiling
- scikit-learn
- Flask

Thank you for your attention!

Have a good day!
